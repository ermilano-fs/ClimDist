# ClimDist

This repository contains an Rmarkdown script and associated data to illustrate the climate analog approach used in following: 
Richardson BA, Rehfeldt GE, SÃ¡enz-Romero C, Milano ER (2024). A climate analog approach to evaluate seed transfer and vegetation transitions. Front. For. Glob. Change 7:1325264. doi: 10.3389/ffgc.2024.1325264 https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2024.1325264/full

This method has been implemented in the Climate Smart Restoration Tool and is available at: https://climaterestorationtool.org
The webtool uses the same approach as the paper but contains updated climate and vegetation inventory data. The new threshold validation can also be found in this repository.
